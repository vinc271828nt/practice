How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    the command located the bug in several lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's much easier for anyone who need to find the places that have been changed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
 
    manual: easy to devide coding in different step but most likyly to forget to commit
    
    auto: avoid forgetting to save but hardly have appropiate granularity

    Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because they are belong to one project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use command git log --stat to find commitID and how many insertions and deletions have been made
    use command git diff commitID commitID to find specific changes in files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    commit before every time I make changes.Make sure one commit matchs one change.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For version contol during coding android app.
